  title: Why Al-Seef
  description: >
    Al-Seef is the coffee store for everyone who believes that great coffee
    shouldn't just taste good, it should do good too. We source all of our beans
    directly from small scale sustainable farmers and make sure part of the
    profits are reinvested in their communities.
description: We have opened 3 distinctively independent Coffee Shops and 1
  Houkah Lounge where coffee and Shisha lovers are served by our team of highly
  skilled baristas.

  heading: Great coffee with no compromises
  description: >
    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
